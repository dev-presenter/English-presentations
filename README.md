## Three things we improve in this group

### 1. English skills

- Read: we improve our ability to read quality articles, summarize them, and understand them.
- Speak: we improve our ability to speak in English by presenting in English.
- Listen: we improve our ability to listen to and understand what others are saying when they present.
- Write: we improve our ability to write feedback in English by commenting on other people's presentations.
- We can broaden our horizons by communicating with software engineers from different countries in English.
- When participating in open-source activities, we need to leave issues and comments in English. This study can prepare us for that.

### 2. Presentation skills

- As for presentations, we give and receive feedback to improve our presentations for the next time. It's important to organize and express our opinions when speaking in front of many people. We practice structuring our thoughts and delivering them clearly so that others can understand.

### 3. Technical skills

- Regarding technology, all official documents are in English. By practicing understanding technical content in English and expressing it verbally, we can improve our ability to understand it.

## Rules & Convention:

### Basics

- We meet on Discord every other Sunday at 8 pm.

### Submitting presentation materials

- Create a folder for the week and make your own file. The folder name should be in lowercase and kebab case (e.g., week-01).
- The file name should be in lowercase and kebab case and include your name and the title (e.g., jayun-hoisting-in-javascript.md).
- Create your own branch (e.g., week-01/jayun).
- When committing, be careful about spacing.
- When submitting your presentation materials, send a PR before 7 pm (1 hour before the presentation).
- Please send your materials in advance so that members can review them beforehand and have a better understanding.
- Merge the PR from your branch to main (e.g., week1/jayun â†’ main) and write a description about what you learned, what you felt, or what you want to explain. (In English!)

### After the presentation:

- Within the same day, before 12 am, give feedback in English as a comment on the PR.
- After receiving feedback, merge it to the main branch.
